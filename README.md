# STAR_Methods

The contents of this repository cover the computational methods used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data. Our trajectory inference framework with pCreode is described [here](https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/pCreode). The pipeline used to generate the data files from sequencing libraries are described in [this repository](https://github.com/Ken-Lau-Lab/STAR_Protocol)
